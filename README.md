Created during the 2013 Hacker Olympics put on by SignalFire, ePIMP makes your party
epic with NFC.

For the Hacker Olympics Afterparty, held at Expensify's offices in San Francisco,
each guest was given an NFC enabled bracelet encoded with an NFC SmartPoster that
pointed NFC enabled devices to a unqiue URL at the expensiparty.com website.

Once there, users can:
* Register their name, email, and telephone number.
* Sign up to participate in Mingle: a game of meeting new people.
* Queue up for activities such as (beer) Pong and the Photoshop Booth.
* Get Bling for playing games and risk it on a group game of Roulette.

This project was created by a team of 7 of the top computer science students in
the country and 2 full-time Expensifiers over the course of around 25 hours.
